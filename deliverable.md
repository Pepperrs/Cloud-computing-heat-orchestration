### 1. Cloud Benchmark

### 2. Introducing Heat

Firstly we need to prepare the environment. We need to create and
upload a ssh key. We need a security group with icmp ingress as well
as port 22 ingress for ssh. Lastly a floating ip is necessary.

``` shell
# create ssh key and upload to openstack
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C $USER
openstack keypair create $USER --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# create security group with icmp and ssh ingress
openstack security group create grp17_security_group
openstack security group rule create grp17_security_group \
  --description icmp-ingress --ingress --protocol icmp
openstack security group rule create grp17_security_group \
  --description ssh-ingress --ingress --protocol tcp --dst-port 22:22

# create floating ip
cc-openstack floating ip create tu-internal
```

Then we can actually create the stack with the correct parameters.

``` shell
openstack stack create \
  --parameter name=grp17_instance \
  --parameter key_pair=$USER \
  --parameter 'flavor=Cloud Computing' \
  --parameter image=ubuntu-16.04 \
  --parameter 'zone=Cloud Computing 2017' \
  --parameter network=cc17-net \
  -t server.yml grp17_stack
```

To have the server reachable, we need to connect it to the floating ip.

``` shell
grp17_ip=$(openstack floating ip list -c 'Floating IP Address' -f value)
openstack server add floating ip grp17_instance $grp17_ip
```

Then we can connect to the server via ssh.

``` shell
ssh ubuntu@$grp17_ip
```

To cleanup, we delete the stack and check the server is gone.

``` shell
openstack stack delete -y grp17_stack
openstack server list
```

### 3. Advanced Heat Templates
